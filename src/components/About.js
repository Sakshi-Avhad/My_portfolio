I’m currently in the final year of my Bachelor’s in Computer Science at Savitribai Phule University,  and I’m actively seeking frontend developer roles and internships to kickstart my career in web development.<br></br><br></br>

I’ve completed the Meta Front-End Developer Certification through Coursera, which has strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and modern frontend practices. Alongside this, I’ve worked on several projects, showcasing my ability to build responsive and user-friendly web applications.<br></br><br></br>

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch—I’d love to collaborate or discuss opportunities!
